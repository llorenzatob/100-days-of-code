# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 03, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: I added a navbar to my project and started creating the posts on node.js

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm starting to really understand node.js and the whole world of web programming, how the requisitions and answers work, I'm very happy to see that my code is actually working in parts.

I also understood how the mongoDB search system works and I plan to structure my TodoList so that each user has his list. I will do this with each user who create an account and create a new collection for him

//NÃ£o esta com a ultima build alteada.


### Day 1: January 04, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: I made the system login, register and changed the display structure of mongoDB.

**Thoughts:** I am very happy that I was able to make the login system, cookie / request and not losing session, everything is going in a surreal way, I am really understanding the programming thing.

I have also been able to adjust my collections for mongoDB, now every user has his own registry and his own lists and things to do.

But I know that there are many, many days to go. I'm making progress!

### Day 2: January 05, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Today I started studying about RestAPIS

**Thoughts:** Today I discovered + - how useful a REST API can be, how much it is needed in today's service systems, since you need to talk to any programming language.

But of code what I did was a RestAPI server that returns information from a shopping cart by ID.

I also developed a ClientSide that searches for this cart and registers new products, if anyone wants to see this one:

But how I'm feeling, I'm a bit tired, I think it's too much focus, but I'm enjoying all this coding too much and learning a lot!

### Day 3: January 06, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Today I did a few things on the coding issue, but in general issues, I had a leftist lecture on REST APIS and I understood that REST is nothing more than good practices for a server.

**Thoughts:** Today I made a grouper that redirects my domain to the various projects I did, basically HTML, JavaScript and CSS. But this legal, was responsive and has perspective of future.

I enjoyed my job
